The SignupReports project has 3 primary components, a shared configuration,
and a cron job script for use in production. In normal use it will create
the specified reports:directory folder and create subfolders named according
to the specified date format. These subfolders organize all of the reports
being generated.

Cron
------------

The cron script is typically the only interface you will need to use and
has the following options:

* --ingest:   Run the ingest script with signups and geocode options.
* --update:   Also run the ingest script with senators and committee options.
              Has no effect if not run with --ingest
* --generate: Run the generate script over all configured districts
* --email:    Run the email script over all configured districts
* --folder:   Directly specify the report directory to operate on. Has no
              effect if not run with either --generate or --email.
* --all:      Run with --ingest, --generate, and --email options


Ingest

The ingest component is responsible for communication with NYSenate.gov and
relies on the components made available in the nysenate_api subdirectory. It
has 5 primary options:

* --senators:   Update the list of senators from NYSenate.gov
* --committees: Update the list of committees from NYSenate.gov
* --signups:    Pull down new signups from NYSenate.gov
